## Baltimore Crime data analysis

I am always concerned about the crime rate in USA as the years are passing, Crime rate is increasing steadily in USA, we think this is primarily because of gun culture in USA and Baltimore is one of the cities where crime rate is even higher compared to national average

This data set contains crime data of baltimore from 2014 to present which will cover various types of crimes and their locations so that citizens of the city tend to know where they should be much careful when crossing across those streets, Crimes are illegal activities which are almost happening everywhere in the united states which threatens the safety of native citizens or even stop tourists to visit places.

### Dataset

Data Source : https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/baltimore::part-1-crime-data-/explore?location=39.300276%2C-76.618650%2C13.00

This data set includes crimes which are made by different types of objects such as personal weapons, knives, handguns and others, this dataset contains 538182 rows and 23 columns 

### Features/variables in the dataset

. crimeDateTime	

. CrimeCode

. Location

. Description

. Inside_Outside	

. Weapon	

. Post	

. Gender	

. Age	

. Race	

. Ethnicity	

. District	

. Neighborhood	

. Latitude	

. Longitude	

. GeoLocation	

. Premise	

. VRIName	

. Total_Incidents	

. Shape


### Techniques :

 . Logistic regression
 
 . Decision tree classifier
 
 . Random forest

I will use above models to predict the crime rate, location where crimes are more and hotspots for crimes where citizens should be even more careful, i will analyse the data to visualize top crime zones, most affected gender, types of crimes etc. this insights will provide us how safer the particular area is.
