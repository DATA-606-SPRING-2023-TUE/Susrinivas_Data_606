# Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a model or system that can accurately predict the fare for a taxi ride in New York City. This prediction is based on various factors such as the distance traveled, the duration of the trip, the time of day, the day of the week, and any additional charges or tolls that may apply.

The project aims to utilize historical data on taxi rides in New York City to train a machine learning model that can make accurate predictions about the fare for a given trip. By analyzing patterns and relationships in the data, the model can learn to estimate the fare based on the input variables provided for a particular ride.

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide an efficient and reliable fare prediction system that can benefit both taxi drivers and passengers. It can help passengers in estimating the cost of their trip beforehand, allowing them to plan their budgets accordingly. For taxi drivers, it can assist in optimizing routes and planning their schedules, potentially increasing their earnings and improving overall efficiency in the taxi industry.


# Introduction

The New York City taxi system is one of the largest and busiest in the world, serving millions of passengers each year. With the vast amount of data generated by taxi rides, there is an opportunity to leverage this information to develop predictive models that can estimate the fare for a given trip. This Project aims for data analysis and machine learning to accurately predict taxi fares in the New York City.

The potential benefits of this project are significant. For passengers, having a fare prediction before starting their journey allows them to plan their budgets more effectively and make informed decisions about their transportation options. It can also help them compare costs between different routes and modes of transportation.

Taxi drivers can benefit from fare prediction by optimizing their routes and schedules based on predicted demand and fares. This can lead to increased earnings and improved efficiency in their operations. Additionally, the fare prediction system can assist taxi companies in managing their fleets more effectively and making data-driven decisions.

To develop the fare prediction model, the project will involve collecting and analyzing a large dataset of historical taxi rides in New York City. The dataset will be used to train and test machine learning algorithms that can learn patterns and relationships between various input variables and the corresponding fares. The trained model will then be deployed in a user-friendly interface or integrated into existing taxi dispatch systems for practical use.

By accurately predicting taxi fares, this project aims to enhance the overall taxi experience for both passengers and drivers, making transportation more reliable, transparent, and convenient.


# Dataset

Data Source:https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data

Dataset contains 229569 rows and 8 columns 

#### ID

key - Unique string identifying each row

#### Features

pickup_datetime - timestamp value indicating when the taxi ride started.

pickup_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.

pickup_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.

dropoff_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.

dropoff_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.

passenger_count - integer indicating the number of passengers in the taxi ride.

#### Target

fare_amount - float dollar amount of the cost of the taxi ride. 


# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 


I have filtered out some columns based on the real time scenario such as distance less than 100 KMS between pickup and drop_off. fare amount greater that 2.5 $ and pickup coordinates are not within NYC(-73.9, 40.7)

Columns in my dataset and their data types

From the above plot it is observed that Average fare is low on Friday and hikes up on Saturday.

From the above plot it is obsereved that Taxi fare has 3 peaks in a day,i.e from 3-6, 13-16 and 23-2. Fare tends are going up after-midnight which could be due to surcharge or the fact that public transportations are closed. so commuters have to use taxi even for long trip.

# Prediction and Comparision of models

Machine Learning models used in this project are regression models as the fare price is continuous variable.

1.Linear regression: 


  
 
 
  
  2.Decision tree Regression


  
 
 
  
  Random Forest


  
 
 
  
  Light Gradient Boosting Machine


  
 
 
  
  Gradient Boosting Regressor


## Comparison of models

Comparing machine learning models by considering root mean square error as evaluation metric, model with least RMSE will be the best model to predict the taxi fares.

## Conclusion

Based on the above used models, Gradient boosting regressor is the best model to predict taxi fare based on demand and predicted taxi fares for the test dataset
